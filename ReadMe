Strassen's multiplication is faster than the standard matrix multiplication.
Strassen's has a time complexity of around O(n^2.81) whereas native multiplication's complexity is O(n^3)
This is because number of multiplications required in strassen's is less.
in the example of multiplying two 2x2 matrices:
Native multiplication will require 8 Multiplications and 4 additions
while Strassen's will require 7 multiplications and 18 additions.
